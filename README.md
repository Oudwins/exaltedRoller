# Exalted Dice Roller

Simple dice roller for Exalted 3e. Uses socket.io for rooms so that all players may be able to see eachother's rolls

## CURRENT USE

Multiple rooms are not yet implemented. Neither is a database, nor a login UI. Therefore, one must add a query string to the end of the url with ?room=sombras&name=[YOURNAME]

## Future Updates

- GUI for joining a room
- Ability to create a room
- User integration to a mongoDB database with regular clean ups
- GUI for choosing your own color
- Tool tip on roll to display all rolls (each die result).
- Page favicon
